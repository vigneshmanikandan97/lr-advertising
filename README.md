# Linear Regression

### Problem Statement: (advertising.ipynb)
An advertising company has historical data of it's sales figures for different types of items like TV, radio, etc.. You are supposed to identify the correlation between these variables and come up with a linear regression model that can predict the number of units sold (for any one variable, or more) with respect to the sales spend.

#### Note:
This repository was created just to practise linear regression and multiple linear regression.
